# User needs are meant to be listened to in the standard format of, as a "user type" I want "a goal" so that "reasoning". This will aid in writing out more technical needs from this idea but get the main idea across. The main goal of working in a Scrum-agile framework is to listen to the customer and have them be an involved part of the development process. This can only be done if they have a say in what is going into the process. 
# I will take the idea of breaking down a major project into smaller user stories or parts with me. Before I just take a project and say, "OK I'm have to accomplish xyz so I just have to do that". There is no breakdown, just an end goal. I think that I can use the idea of user stories and event sprints in my future so that I can accomplish projects more efficiently. 
# Being a good team member is listening to criticism, giving constructive criticism, and working with other developers. It is not a competition to be the best programmer and we should all work together to get the project done as efficiently as possible, building each other up as we go.
